ABC CARS is a result of diligent professionals of the acclaimed Indian IT powerhouse Girnar Software Pvt. Ltd working together to simplify auto needs. It started making its baseline in the world wide web with its Indian-based auto portal CarDekho, which is India's largest Auto portal. ABC CARS is the International Version of CarDekho. After expanding in the Indian auto market and providing the Indian audiences with the best of the auto information and advises, the company decided in March 2015 to extend its roots to different ASEAN countries. Currently, our portal is active in 27 countries Globally and Bangladesh is a part of the same elite group. CarDekho has received immense love and support from the Indian audience and has become one of the largest auto portals of the country in no time. ABC CARS is a new entity and with a larger scope of audiences, connecting the whole auto world together. From the day of its inception the portal has gained a lot of accolades both from the visitors and major auto world giants. With an aim to provide our users the best of simplified information and updates, we have endeavored to be one of the largest auto portals in Bangladesh. 
ABC CARS   is stuffed with a large array of tools that serve diverse needs of visitors. We not only provide information on the new and used cars but also provide with their entire Specifications, Reviews and News about cars, the upcoming updates and facelifts and also an 'Alert me When Launched' option so that whenever that specific model is launched in the Bangladeshi market, an automated notification goes to the user. Another interesting segment is the Feature and Advisory stories. The Advisory stories say about the new technologies and technical information about how to keep your car as good as new whereas Features are the lighter part of the car stories which connect lifestyle entities to the auto world. The site also keeps you updated about the latest discounts and offers given by the dealers, car care tips, expert advises and much more.
